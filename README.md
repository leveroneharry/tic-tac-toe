# Tic Tac Toe

## Description
Tic Tac Toe was recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a learning exercise. The game is complete, but updates to the project may be made as new JavaScript features are tested. The rules of the game may also be adapted from the original version of the game. If so, they will be reflected in the rules section below.

## Rules
- Tic Tac Toe is a two player game played on a 3 by 3 board.
- Player 1 will mark squares on the board using an 'X'.
- Player 2 will mark squares on the board using an 'O'.
- To start the game, player 1 marks one of the empty squares on the board with an 'X'.
- Player 2 follows by marking another empty square with an 'O'.
- The players should continue marking the board until there is a win or a draw.
- The first player to get three 'X's or three 'O's in a row wins.
- Note that "three in a row" can be in any direction: row-wise, column-wise, or diagonally.
- If there are no more empty squares to mark, and neither player has won, then the game ends in a draw.

## Usage
