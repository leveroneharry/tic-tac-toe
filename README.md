# Tic Tac Toe

## Overview
A recreatation of the game, Tic Tac Toe, in the web browser.

## Description
Tic Tac Toe was recreated using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as a learning exercise. Although the game is in a playable state, updates to the project may be made as new JavaScript libraries and frameworks are tested. The rules of the game may also be adapted from the original version of the game, so be sure to check out the rules section below for the most up-to-date rules.

## Rules
As it stands, the rules of the game have not deviated from the original version of the game: 
- Tic Tac Toe is a two player game.
- Player 1 will mark squares on the board using an 'X'.
- Player 2 will mark squares on the board using an 'O'.
- To start the game, player 1 will go first, marking one of the empty squares on the 3x3 board with an 'X'.
- Player 2 will follow by marking another empty square with an 'O'.
- Players 1 and 2 will continue to alternate turns, marking squares on the board in the same fashion.
- The first player to get 3 'X's or 3 'O's in a row wins.
- Note that '3 in a row' can be in the row direction, column direction, or diagonally.
- If neither player achieves 3 in a row, and there are no more empty squares, the game ends in a draw.

## Usage
To play the game, you may fork the project or download the files, then run the project in your web browser.
